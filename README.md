This repository contains:
   my-simple_lin-reg.py: it is a package that contains a class with functions to build my model from scratch, these functions are:
                         1- TrainTestSplitter: to split data to train and test 
                         2- StandardScalertransform: to standardize X
                         3- minMaxScaler: to normalize X
                         4- coefficents: to get the weights
                         5- SimpleLinearRegression: to get my own predictions
                         6- Evaluate: to evaluate my model
   my_package.ipynb: my own package in ipynb extension
   Compare_my_model.ipynb: it is a programm where import my own package in it and compare my model with sklearn model
   Insurance.xls: The data which i used to build my model, it contains one feature (X) and label (y)
